# Native-platform: Java bindings for native APIs

A collection of cross-platform Java APIs for various native APIs. Currently supports OS X, Linux, Windows and FreeBSD
on Intel architectures.

These APIs support Java 5 and later. Some of these APIs overlap with APIs available in later Java versions.

## Available bindings

## Using

Include `native-platform.jar` and `native-platform-${os}-${arch}.jar` in your classpath. From Gradle, you can do
this:

    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile "net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform:0.21"
    }

You can also download the Jars from [bintray](https://bintray.com/adammurdoch/maven/net.rubygrapefruit%3Anative-platform)

A test application is also available from [bintray](https://bintray.com/adammurdoch/maven/net.rubygrapefruit%3Anative-platform-test)

Some sample code to use the terminal:

    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.Native;
    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.terminal.Terminals;
    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.terminal.TerminalOutput;
    import static net.rubygrapefruit.platform.terminal.Terminals.Output.*;

    Terminals terminals = Native.get(Terminals.class);

    // check if terminal
    terminals.isTerminal(Stdout);

    // use terminal
    TerminalOutput stdout = terminals.getTerminal(Stdout);
    stdout.bold();
    System.out.println("bold text");

# Development

## Building

This project uses (Gradle)[https://www.gradle.org] to build. Just run `gradlew` in the root of the source repo.
You will need Java 8 or later to run the tests.

### Ubuntu

The g++ compiler is required to build the native library. You will need to install the `g++` package for this.
Alternatively, you can use the Clang C++ compiler.

You need to install the `libncurses5-dev` package to pick up the ncurses header files. Also worth installing the `ncurses-doc` package too.

#### 64-bit machines with multi-arch support

Where multi-arch support is available (e.g. recent Ubuntu releases), you can build the i386 and amd64 versions of the library on the
same machine.

You need to install the `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib` packages to pick up i386 support.

You need to install the `lib32ncurses5-dev` package to pick up the ncurses i386 version.

### Windows

You need to install Visual studio 2012 or later, plus the Windows SDK to allow you to build both x86 and x64 binaries.

### OS X

The clang compiler is required to build the native library. You will need to install the XCode command-line tools for this.

### Solaris

For Solaris 11, you need to install the `development/gcc-45` and `system/header` packages.

## Running

Run `gradlew installDist` to install the test application into `test-app/build/install/native-platform-test`. Or
`gradle distZip` to create an application distribution in `test-app/build/distributions/native-platform-test-$version.zip`.

You can run `$INSTALL_DIR/bin/native-platform-test` to run the test application.

## Testing integration with another project

When developing a new feature in native platform, you often want to test the features in a real-world project which uses native platform.
There are various ways how to test the changes of native platform in the consuming project.

### Use composite build on a developer machine

#### From the command line

From the checkout directory of the consuming project you can run:

```sh
./gradlew --include-build ../native-platform ...
```

This assumes that `native-platform` is checked out in `../native-platform` relative to the consuming project.

#### From IDEA

In IDEA, open the consuming project.
Then [link the `native-platform` project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#link_gradle_project).
Finally, add the linked `native-platform` project [as a participant to the Gradle build](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-projects.html#gradle_composite_build) and sync the consuming project.

> **WARNING**: You need to use IDEA 2020.1 for the composite build to work.
> See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-228368 and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-206799.

### Use a published snapshot on a developer machine/CI

- Publish a snapshot from the branch you want to test by using [this Teamcity build](https://builds.gradle.org/buildConfiguration/GradleNative_NativePlatform_Publishing_PublishJavaApiSnapshot?mode=builds).
- Change the version of native platform in the consuming project to match the version you just published, e.g. `0.22-snapshot-20200128143135+0000`,
  and push the changes to a branch.
- Run some tests on CI on the branch of the consuming project you just pushed.
- Test what you want to test on the consuming project.

### Use `mavenLocal()` on a developer machine

- Install a dev version of native platform to your local Maven repository by running
    ```sh
    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -PonlyLocalVariants
    ```
- Add `mavenLocal()` as a repository in the consuming project.
- Change the version of native platform in the consuming project to match the version you just built, e.g. `0.22-dev`.
- Test what you want to test on the consuming project.

    * OS X message center
    * Growl
    * Snarl
    * dnotify
* Locate various system directories (eg program files on windows).
